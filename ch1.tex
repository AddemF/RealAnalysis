	{\Large Problem 1

	 If $r\in\mathbb{I}=\mathbb{R}\setminus \mathbb{Q}$ and $x\in\mathbb{Q}$ prove that $r+x, rx \in\mathbb{I}$.}

	By hypothesis there are no integers $a,b$ such that $r=a/b$, but there are integers such that $x=a/b$.  In particular let's say $x=a/b$ where $b\ne 0$ and $gcd(a,b)=1$.  For contradiction suppose $r+x = p/q$ for integers $p,q$.  This would imply

	\begin{align*}
		r = p/q - x = \frac{pb-aq}{bq} \in \mathbb{Q}
	\end{align*}

	Also for contradiction assume $rx\in \mathbb{Q}$ and $rx = p/q$ to lazily re-use our old symbols.  Then so long as $a\ne 0$ we have

	\begin{align*}
		r = \frac{p}{q}\frac{1}{x} = \frac{pb}{qa} \in \mathbb{Q}
	\end{align*}

	and if $a=0$ then of course $rx = ra/b = 0\in\mathbb{Q}$.

	{\Large Problem 2

	Prove there is no rational square-root of 12.}

	%Suppose $a/b=\sqrt{12}$ with $gcd(a,b)=1$ and $b\ne 0$.  Then $a^2 = 12b^2$ which implies $a$ has a factor of 3.  Therefore $a^2$ has two factors of 3.  Therefore $b$ must be furnishing at least one factor of 3, since 12 is only furnishing one.  But then $gcd(a,b) > 1$.
